Great question! Yes, it automatically looks at the webpack configuration. Let me explain exactly how this works:

## How Webpack Resolves `'products/ProductsIndex'`

When webpack encounters the import `'products/ProductsIndex'`, it follows this process:

### 1. **Check the `remotes` configuration**
In `container/webpack.config.js`:
```javascript
remotes: {
  products: 'products@http://localhost:8081/remoteEntry.js'
}
```

Webpack sees that `products` is defined as a remote, so it knows this isn't a local import.

### 2. **Fetch the remote entry point**
Webpack makes a request to `http://localhost:8081/remoteEntry.js` to get the remote's module map.

### 3. **Look up the exposed module**
The `remoteEntry.js` file contains information about what the `products` microfrontend exposes. From `products/webpack.config.js`:
```javascript
exposes: {
  './ProductsIndex': './src/index'
}
```

So when you import `'products/ProductsIndex'`, webpack:
- Recognizes `products` as a remote (from the `remotes` config)
- Fetches the remote entry point from port 8081
- Looks up `./ProductsIndex` in the exposed modules
- Maps it to `./src/index` (which is `products/src/index.js`)

## The Magic Happens at Runtime

This is different from regular imports because:

- **Regular imports**: Resolved at build time, bundled together
- **Module Federation imports**: Resolved at runtime, loaded dynamically

When the container app runs:
1. It loads its own bundle
2. When it hits `import 'products/ProductsIndex'`, it makes a network request to get the products microfrontend
3. The products microfrontend runs and renders its content

## You can see this in action:

If you open the browser dev tools and look at the Network tab, you'll see requests to:
- `http://localhost:8081/remoteEntry.js` (the module map)
- `http://localhost:8081/src_bootstrap_js.js` (the actual products code)

This is why both applications need to be running simultaneously - the container literally fetches the products microfrontend over HTTP at runtime!

The webpack configuration acts as the "contract" that tells each microfrontend what it can consume and what it exposes to others.
